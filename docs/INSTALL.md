# Installing PVYai

PVYai is distributed as:

- an npm package, `@pvyswiss/pvyai`
- release archives on GitHub Releases
- source builds with Go 1.25+

The npm package and install scripts download a platform-specific release archive.
They require a published GitHub Release for the requested version.

## npm

```bash
npm install -g @pvyswiss/pvyai
pvyai
```

The package supports Linux, macOS, and Windows on x64 and arm64. It installs the
`pvyai` command and downloads the matching release binary during `postinstall`.

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- network access to npm and GitHub Releases

## Bun

Bun is "default-secure" and does not run lifecycle scripts of installed
dependencies (only the installing project's own scripts), so the `postinstall`
that fetches the PVYai binary is silently skipped. The first run then fails with
`No native binary found next to the npm wrapper`.

The simplest fix is to trust the package after installing, which runs the
blocked postinstall. This works for project and global installs:

```bash
# project install
bun add @pvyswiss/pvyai
bun pm trust @pvyswiss/pvyai

# global install
bun add -g @pvyswiss/pvyai
bun pm -g trust @pvyswiss/pvyai
```

`bun pm untrusted` (or `bun pm -g untrusted`) lists the blocked postinstalls if
you want to inspect before trusting.

Alternatively, allow the postinstall to run at install time by adding the
package to your project's `trustedDependencies` before installing:

```json
{
  "trustedDependencies": ["@pvyswiss/pvyai"]
}
```

```bash
bun add @pvyswiss/pvyai
```

On Bun versions that do not have `bun pm trust`, run the installer manually
after installing:

```bash
node node_modules/@pvyswiss/pvyai/scripts/postinstall.mjs
```

## Linux And macOS Script

Install the latest release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvyswiss/pvyai/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

From a checkout:

```bash
scripts/install.sh
```

Install a specific version:

```bash
PVYAI_VERSION=0.1.0 scripts/install.sh
scripts/install.sh --version 0.1.0
```

Install somewhere else:

```bash
PVYAI_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin" scripts/install.sh
scripts/install.sh --install-dir "$HOME/bin"
```

Defaults:

- Repository: `pvyswiss/pvyai`
- Version: latest GitHub release
- Install path: `~/.local/bin/pvyai`

Requirements: Bash, `curl` or `wget`, `tar`, and `shasum` or `sha256sum`.

## Windows PowerShell Script

Install the latest release:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvyswiss/pvyai/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

From a checkout:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install.ps1
```

Install a specific version:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install.ps1 -Version 0.1.0
```

Install somewhere else:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install.ps1 -InstallDir "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
```

Defaults:

- Repository: `pvyswiss/pvyai`
- Version: latest GitHub release
- Install path: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pvyai\bin\pvyai.exe`

## From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvyswiss/pvyai.git
cd pvyai
go run ./cmd/pvyai
```

Build a local binary:

```bash
go build -o pvyai ./cmd/pvyai
```

Source builds require Go 1.25+.

### Sandbox Helpers For Source Builds

Release archives include the platform sandbox helpers. If you build directly
from source, build the helpers you need:

Linux:

```bash
go build -o pvyai ./cmd/pvyai
go build -o pvyai-linux-sandbox ./cmd/pvyai-linux-sandbox
go build -o pvyai-seccomp ./cmd/pvyai-seccomp
```

Put `pvyai` and `pvyai-linux-sandbox` in the same directory on `PATH`, for example
`~/.local/bin`. `pvyai-seccomp` is kept as a compatibility wrapper; the sandbox
helper applies the Unix-socket filter itself when that sandbox option is enabled.
Linux native sandboxing also requires Bubblewrap to be installed.

macOS uses the system sandbox and does not need an extra helper binary.

### Termux (Android)

PVYai can run natively on Android via [Termux](https://termux.dev/). Build with
`GOOS=android` to avoid the `faccessat2` syscall that is blocked by Samsung's
seccomp filter on Android:

```bash
# Install Go in Termux
pkg install golang

# Build PVYai for Android
git clone https://github.com/pvyswiss/pvyai.git
cd pvyai
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=android GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o pvyai ./cmd/pvyai

# Move into PATH
mv pvyai ~/.local/bin/
```

> **Why `GOOS=android`?** Go 1.26+ detects `runtime.GOOS == "android"` and skips
> the `faccessat2` syscall inside `os/exec.findExecutable`, falling back to
> permission-bit checks. Without this flag, Android's seccomp sends SIGSYS and
> kills the process whenever PVYai looks up a binary on `PATH` (git, sh, etc.).

**DNS.** Android does not expose `/etc/resolv.conf`. Go's pure-Go DNS resolver
needs one. Use `proot` to bind-mount Termux's resolver config:

```bash
pkg install proot
proot -b "$PREFIX/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf" pvyai
```

Create a wrapper at `~/.local/bin/pvyai` to avoid typing proot every time:

```bash
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
exec proot -b "$PREFIX/etc/resolv.conf:/etc/resolv.conf" ~/.local/bin/pvyai.bin "$@"
```

**Scroll.** On native Termux (not under PRoot), mouse scrolling works out of the
box. The TUI uses Bubble Tea's `AllMotion` mouse mode by default. If you run PVYai
inside PRoot (e.g. through proot-distro), the scroll fix activates `CellMotion`
to avoid PRoot's ptrace interference with the 1003 escape sequence.

**Providers.** PVYai works with any OpenAI-compatible provider on Termux. For
example, to use OpenCode Zen's free tier:

```bash
pvyai providers add opencode \
  --name opencode \
  --model deepseek-v4-flash-free \
  --base-url https://opencode.ai/zen/v1 \
  --set-active
```

Windows source builds can use the main `pvyai.exe` as the command runner and setup
helper through PVYai's built-in self-dispatch path. If you want a release-style
layout anyway, build the standalone helper executables next to `pvyai.exe`:

```powershell
go build -o pvyai.exe ./cmd/pvyai
go build -o pvyai-windows-command-runner.exe ./cmd/pvyai-windows-command-runner
go build -o pvyai-windows-sandbox-setup.exe ./cmd/pvyai-windows-sandbox-setup
```

## Release Archive Format

Release archives are named:

- `pvyai-v<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`
- `pvyai-v<version>-macos-<arch>.tar.gz`
- `pvyai-v<version>-windows-<arch>.zip`

Supported targets:

- `linux-x64`
- `linux-arm64`
- `macos-x64`
- `macos-arm64`
- `windows-x64`
- `windows-arm64`

Each archive must have a matching `.sha256` file. The install scripts download
both files, verify the checksum, and then copy the binary into the install
directory.

## Updating

Check for a newer release:

```bash
pvyai update --check
```

Then reinstall with npm or rerun the install script for the version you want.
