// EnvWebhookURL unset the wiring helper attaches nothing and the notifier
// behaves exactly as before.

// MaybeAddWebhookSink attaches a webhook sink to n when a webhook URL is present
// in the environment, and is otherwise a no-op. env resolves an environment
// variable (pass os.Getenv); logf records one redacted line per failed delivery
// (pass nil to stay silent — for example a TUI that owns the screen). It is safe
// to call unconditionally: configuration alone decides whether the sink exists.
//
// The attached sink is still subject to the notifier's Mode/focus policy, so a
// webhook only delivers when notifications are enabled (for example
// `--notify both`), matching the rest of the notification surface.
